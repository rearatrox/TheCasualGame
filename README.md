# TheCasualGame

I created this Game to improve my skills with C# and Unity.
I tested it on several Android Phones and shared it with some friends. 

# How To Play

Currently, the Game consists of 5 playable levels, but you wont find any Tutorial how to play it, so heres a short guide:

- Movement of the ball is based on where you're touching. 
- The further left or right you press on the screen, the steeper the ball flies.
- To reach a level, you simply need to get all Diamonds and pass the level (on the top).
- If you want to get a "green hook" on your level, you need to be faster than the moving line below you.

# First Level - Attention

On the first level, you will find an invisible area, where left and right are switched. This was just an experimental try which I didnt delete in this version.
